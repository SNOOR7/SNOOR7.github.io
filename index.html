    <h3>3D Space Project 2021: Solar System</h3>
    <p>
        My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
        City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a beginnners understanding 
        of the use of arrays, randomness, classes and 3D. I created a space scene in which 
        details of each star (e.g. position, color and size and shape) are stored in arrays.
        Stars are arranged with random sizes between 1 and 3, this creates the sparkle and
        creates the impression of space. Next was creating the 3D planets and having them be placed 
        in order of closest to the sun. I then added rotation to each planet and to the Sun and
        gave each of them lighting to give of a realistic feel in regards to the reflection of the
        suns light. Finally, I added a feature where the user can press a key
        (first letter of the planet's name) to swap the middle planet that is default selected as Earth.
        This part was supposed to much cooler as you could hover your mouse over the planet 
        to select it and the stats for the selected planet would show 
        (i.e. temp, size compared to Earth, distance from the Sun, etc...). 
        Unfortunately, I ran out of time for that. :(

      <h3>2D Game Project 2022: Isekai Adventures</h3>
      <p>
        My second programming project, concluding the Java Programming module at 
        City (2022). This long term Java project demonstrates my understanding 
        of object oriented programming through the use of inheritance, classes and collisons with objects.
